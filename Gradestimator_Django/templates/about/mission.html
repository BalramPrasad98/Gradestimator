    <h1><div id=logo>Our Product:</div></h1>
    <p class="lead">At Gradestimator, we believe that students should be
      equipped with the knowledge necessary for them to succeed in the classroom,
      and that this process starts before they purchase textbooks. Our goal is to
      provide students with a realistic idea of how they will perform in a given
      course based on their performance in previous courses. </br></br>
      Utilizing analytics, our product helps students understand how they will
      perform in a given course based on their course history and the academic
      records of students who performed similarly.

      <dt class="col-md-2">Step 1: </dt>
      <dd class="col-md-10">A student selects a course that they would like the
        Gradestimator to generate a prediction for.</dd>

      <dd class="col-md-10">Utilizing data for all students the Gradestimator
        identifies courses that may serve as a good predictor for the student's
        selected course. </dd>

      <dd class="col-md-10">And now for the magic! Based on the information
        provided by the student, the Gradestimator identifies other students
        who took the course grade to be predicted as well as had a similar course
        history. Based on these students the Gradestimator will provide a
        recommendation on how it believe the student will perform in the course</dd>
