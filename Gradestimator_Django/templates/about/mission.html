    <h1>How it works:</h1>
    <p class="lead">At Gradestimator, we believe that students should be
      equipped with the knowledge necessary for them to succeed in the classroom,
      and that this process starts before they purchase textbooks. Our goal is to
      provide students with a realistic idea of how they will perform in a given
      course based on their performance in previous courses. Utilizing
      analytics, we identify other students who have similar academic backgrounds,
      and use their performance to provide an accurate prediction.
