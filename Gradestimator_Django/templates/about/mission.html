    <h1><div id=logo>Our Product:</div></h1>
    <p class="lead">At Gradestimator, we believe that students should be
      equipped with the knowledge necessary for them to succeed in the classroom,
      and that this process starts before they purchase textbooks. Our goal is to
      provide students with a realistic idea of how they will perform in a given
      course based on their performance in previous courses. </br></br>
      Utilizing analytics, our product helps students understand how they will
      perform in a given course based on their course history and the academic
      records of students who performed similarly.
